								<p><strong>Brightfox</strong> is an online healthcare staffing platform that cuts out the staffing agency middlemen within the healthcare industry. As a <strong>Data Aggregation Engineer</strong>, it was my responsibility to design & develop BrightFox's creative data-extraction and transformation application. The application uses a modular design of systems that are completely independent of one another, ensuring the failure of one does not affect the success of the others.</p>
								<p> Currently this application processes over 30 unique healthcare systems, which brings in the data from hundreds of thousands of hospital staffing positions across the nation into the BrightFox database.</p>
								<p>Due to the volitile nature of any startup company, I had to be ready to pivor my focus at a moments notice, based on the outcome of our weekly team meetings and the success or faulure of our recent efforts.</p>
								<p>Unfortunately, my time with BrightFox was cut short due to the economic impact that the <strong>2020 Corona virus</strong> had on the United States.</p>

								<p>Wanna Train is a wellness community, where anyone can meet up and workout by simply sending a “Wanna Train" invitation.</p>
								<p>As one of the developers of Wanna Train I was responsible for implementing feature-requests, design specifications, bug resolutions, clearly communicating between the various departments of WannaTrain - be it the Testing Department, Administration or internally within the Development Team, all the while ensuring my code meets standards & has been thoroughly vetted before submission.</p>
								<p>WannaTrain is unique in the fact that the development team is not based in the United States - or even the company itself! The team consists of a group of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_nomad">Digital Nomads</a> spanning a number of countries and timezones.</p>
								<p>Working here taught me the importance of being a <strong>self-sustaining</strong> and <strong>accountable</strong> developer; because if I ran into a problem at 9:00 AM EST, I had no one but myself to help solve it until around 9:00 PM - 11:00 PM EST.</p>
								<p>Similarly, if some of my code does not pass review, I would not know about it until a couple of days later, due to timezone constraints, potentially missing deadlines.</p>
								<p>This means that I had to be certain that I wrote code that will hold up to specifications & expectations.</p>

								<p>SocialPnt is a location-based social media app, that brings users together through pnts (points) in time. Users can discover what is going on around them, stay in touch with the people who matter the most and capture & relive every moment again and again.</p>
								<p>I built SocialPnt from the ground up, learning on the way what it really takes to create a end-to-end mobile application from start to finish. SocialPnt covers six different programming languages, has over 45 service providers, 84 individual pages, countless components and numerous technological integrations.</p>
								<p>SocialPnt has been my pride and joy for a little more than a year now. It started with whiteboard drawings, copious amounts of chicken-scratched notes and lots caffeine. It then moved to <strong>Sketch</strong> design mockups, proof of concepts, technology selection, and about six months of solo development & testing.</p>
								<p>SocialPnt is <strong>live</strong> on the IOS App store, but there isn't a day that goes by, that I don't think of new ways I could improve upon it. Optimizations, new implementations, integrations and a better tomorrow for everyone who uses the app, is always my goal.</p>
								<p>SocialPnt was a daunting task that I wasn't confident I would be able to complete in the beginning, but eventually - I did. And I cannot tell you how great that feels.</p>

									<a class="col-md-4 col-12" href="https://https://github.com/Bengejd/Ionic-Plugin-Assistant" target="_blank"><img alt="IPA" class="img-fluid project-image" src="assets/images/projects/IPA_LOGO.png"></a>
								</div>
								<div class="desc text-left">
									<p class="mb-2">IPA was made to make the average Ionic developers life a little bit easier, when wanting to create the own plugin for the Ionic Framework. Creating a plugin takes a <strong>LOT</strong> initial setup. I've written <a href="https://medium.com/@JordanBenge/how-to-write-an-ionic-cordova-plugin-in-swift-8d443430b27d">Medium articles</a> about how to properly setup plugins, but I felt like even with that, the process was too convoluted for some.</p>
									<p>So instead, I wanted to make the process easier - so I created the Ionic Plugin Assistant - IPA for short. Creating the package also made my life easier, because despite writing about the topic, I'm human and forget some of the steps, and often have to Google specifics - which lead me to <strong>my</strong> article.</p>
									<p>When you run IPA, it will ask you a few questions about your plugin, such as: the plugin name, the authors name, github repo, license, etc... and then generate all of the boilerplate code, to the point that you could <strong>technically</strong> submit it to the Ionic Native platform as a new plugin - but it would probably be closed for lack of functionality.</p>
									<p>IPA ensures that your plugin will adhear to Ionic plugin standards, common community standards, and set you up for success when it comes to making your plugin. This isn't to say that it will write your plugin for you, but it will give you a basic setup to get started with, where there was none to begin with.</p>
									<p>The library generates 11 files, all with unique requirements to properly work in your specific platform & within the Ionic Framework</p>
									<p>I opened-sourced IPA under the MIT license.</p>

								<h3 class="title">Toggl Invoice Generator <span class="badge badge-theme">Public</span></h3>
								<p class="mb-2">This was a quality of life improvement type of project for me. My team and I use Toggl to track our hours for working remotely, but Toggl requires a premium account for invoice generation, and even then, the invoices were not all that nice to look at. Since I do not control the team account, I was left with having to generate my invoices each week by hand.</p>
								<p>This was a necessary evil, and often I dreaded having to do it. A lot goes into proper invoice generation for our company - calculating each individual task's hourly rate, calculating the total invoice cost and time, updating the appropriate dates and payout periods, bumping the invoice number, etc... all in all, it would take me about an hour or two every two weeks, depending on how many tickets I cleared that pay period, but I always dreaded it.</p>
								<p>So I decided one day that I was tired of generating the invoices by hand, and set out to try and automate it for myself. Toggl's documentation is really nice, but the hardest part was properly filling out my invoice template that I had gotten attached to over time.</p>
								<p>After a few hours of trial and error (Python and DocX files don't like each-other when tables are involved), I streamlined that process from an hour or two every two weeks to about three seconds. Now it automatically pulls my work hours from the last two weeks, using the Toggl API, generates the invoice, increments the invoice number, totals the hours, calculates my hourly rate for each item I worked on and then updates a local database with the relevant information for archival purposes. Now all I have do to is drag the file into Google Drive, and send it off to my boss to get paid.</p>

After searching around for a bit, I discovered <a href="https://branch.io/">Branch.io</a> and immediately fell in love with their service. There was only one catch. I had to get an email link from Firebase, which was only accessible via their Dynamic Link service.</p>
								<p>After doing some digging I came up with a solution that leveraged Branch.io's edge cases with Firebase's email link, and was given warm remarks from one of the Branch.io developers for my work. He said he would pass my solution onto their documentation team to see if it could be added to the repository, as he felt that other developers would benefit from it.</p>

								<h3 class="title">Ionic <span class="badge badge-theme">Long-standing issue documentation</span></h3>
								<p class="mb-2">This was an issue that I originally opened with the Ionic team, but despite receiving quite some notoriety within the community it was unfortunately left unsolved. The issue was with their <strong>Ionic cordova build prod</strong> command running out of memory, even on high-end devices. This was due to one of the optimizations that the command was running. The flag was causing a memory-leak within some of their dependencies and the recursive use of non-project file-paths.</p>
								<p>This issue was only prevalent in large-scale projects, and would not be noticed by beginners or simpler applications.</p>
								<p>After three months of testing out fixes and hoping that the team would address this issue officially, I came up with a solution that solved the issue at large. Later on ths issue was fixed in their <strong>4.0</strong> release of Ionic, but for <strong>3.x</strong> users like myself, the compiled solution worked in the meantime.</p>

								<p class="mb-2">This was something that I originally ran into while using the Camera-Preview plugin. The basis of the issue was with implementing a pinch-to-zoom directive, when you couldn't interact with the camera preview directly due to library limitations.</p>
								<p>I ended up posting this solution for another user who opened the same issue that I encountered while originally implementing the plugin.</p>
