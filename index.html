                            <p>I am a Software Developer based in Oxford Ohio. I specialize in designing and developing
                                mobile-first web applications; be it
                                professional freelance opportunities, or personal projects, all the while studying

                                The things that I believe set me apart from everyone else is my passion and

                                and discipline that goes into Software Development and I always strive for <strong>

                                <p>SocialPnt has been my pride and joy for a little more than a year now. It started
                                    with whiteboard drawings, copious amounts of chicken scratched notes and
                                    caffeine. It then moved to <strong>Sketch</strong>design mockups, proof of concepts,
                                    technology selection, and about 6 months of
                                    development & testing.

                                <p>SocialPnt is live on the App store, but that doesn't stop
                                    me from constantly trying to best myself. I always am thinking of new
                                    implementations, optimizations, and a better tomorrow for everyone who uses the
                                    app.</p>

                                    throughout the development lifecycle.
                                    This included keeping thorough documentation on projects status, development
                                    and team work-ability.

                                    I was on the ground floor when it came to re-designing the Office of Research
                                    website, a project that I pushed for almost immediately upon coming into my role.
                                    I spent a lot of days in meetings, with every department head discussing their
                                    needs, and how we could implement them in a way that it
                                    was easy to find any information that you were looking for.

                                <p>I helped our team solve new and interesting problems. I used a wide variety of technologies to tackle these problems including, AngularJS, HTML, OS Api's, and others. With a small focused team, we all shared the success of each other. This personal investment allowed me to interact with a new, growing team in an environment that I had never experienced before.
                                    Though my time with the company was short, due to my constraints of being a student, the things that I learned were invaluable. </p>

                                        within the Ionic community to be lacking. It utilizes a users camera to
                                        create a camera preview that is streamed straight from their phone, into any
                                        HTML view that they want.

                                        offer one or the other.

                                        themselves to facilitate better events in the future.

                                        after some privacy concerns with the Facebook Developer API, which fueled the
                                        application.</p>

                                        FSApp is build using the open-source project

                                        immerse the user into the rich history of the Freedom Summer, while using
                                        real-time image recognition to project historical images onto the users

                                        The app is currently in Beta,
                                        and only available to pre-approved testers.

                                    I had a friend who kept getting kicked from our Fraternity GroupMe, and would subsequently be out of the GroupMe more than he was in it.

                                <p> Simply put, the bot watches the GroupMe and waits for a notification that
                                    someone was removed. Once the notification is found, it quickly cross-checks
                                    the user ID that was removed to see if it was this particular friend, or
                                    myself and re-adds the user.</p>

                                    This was probably the first time that I felt like a true developer. I was looking
                                    to integrate Firebase's
                                    <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/dynamic-links/">Dynamic Link</a>
                                    service, but shortly after realized that it has a lot of flaws while implementing
                                    their native SDK. After searching around for a bit, I discovered
                                    <a href="https://branch.io/">Branch.io</a> and immediately fell in love with
                                    their service. There was only one catch. I had to get the email link from
                                    Firebase, and could not get around that issue.

                                    This was an issue that I originally opened with the Ionic team, but unfortunately
                                    was left unanswered, despite receiving quite some notoriety within the community.
                                    The issue was with their production build command running out of memory, even on
                                    high-end devices due to memory-leakages with some of their dependencies and the
                                    recursive use of file-paths.

                                <p>So you’ve found out that the plugin that you’ve been using isn’t all it’s chopped up to be? Or better yet, you found an amazing Swift library, that does everything you want it to do, and more. Well, that was exactly the point that I had reached while surfing the plugin list that Ionic showcases.</p>
