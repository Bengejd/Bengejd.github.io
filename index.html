                        <p>I am a Software Developer based in Oxford, Ohio. I specialize in designing and developing
                            mobile-first web applications; be it
                            professional freelance opportunities or personal projects, all the while studying
                            Computer Science at Miami University.

                            The things that I believe set me apart from everyone else is my passion and
                            dedication for any project that I work on. I <strong>love</strong> the creativity
                            and discipline that goes into Software Development and I always strive for <strong>
                            scalable</strong>
                            and clean

                            </h3>
                            <p> Wanna Train is a wellness community, where anyone can meet up and workout by simply
                                sending a “Wanna Train" invitation.
                            </p>
                            <p> As one of the developers of Wanna Train I am responsible for implementing
                                feature-requests, design specifications, bug resolutions, clearly communicating
                                between the various departments of WannaTrain - be it the Testing Department,
                                Administration or internally within the development department, all the while ensuring
                                my code meets standards & has been thoroughly vetted before submission.
                            </p>
                            <p> WannaTrain is unique in the fact that the development team is not based in the United
                                States - or even the company itself! The team consists of a group of
                                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_nomad">Digital Nomads</a> spanning a
                                number of countries and timezones.
                            </p>
                            <p>Working here has taught me the importance of being a
                                <strong>self-sustaining </strong> and <strong>accountable</strong> developer;
                                because if I run into a problem at 9:00 AM EST, I have no one but myself to help solve
                                it until around 9:00 PM - 11:00 PM EST.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Similarly, if some of my code does not pass review, I won't know about it until a
                                couple of days later, due to timezone constraints, potentially missing deadlines.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This means that I have to be certain that I wrote code that will hold up to
                                specifications & expectations.

                            <p> SocialPnt is a location-based social media app, that brings users together through
                                pnts (points) in time. Users can discover what is going on around them, stay in touch
                                with the people who matter the most and capture & relive every moment again and again.
                            </p>
                            <p> I built SocialPnt from the ground, learning on the way what it really takes to create a
                                end-to-end mobile application from start to finish. SocialPnt covers
                                <strong>six</strong> different programming languages, has over <strong>45
                                </strong> service providers, <strong>84</strong> individual pages,
                                <strong>countless</strong> components and <strong>numerous</strong> technological
                                integrations.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                SocialPnt has been my pride and joy for a little more than a year now.
                                It started with whiteboard drawings, copious amounts of chicken-scratched notes and
                                lots caffeine. It then moved to <strong>Sketch</strong> design mockups, proof of
                                concepts, technology selection, and about six months of solo development & testing.
                            </p>
                            <p>SocialPnt is <strong>live</strong> on the IOS App store, but there isn't a day that goes
                                by, that I don't think of new ways I could improve upon it. Optimizations, new
                                implementations,
                                integrations and a better tomorrow for everyone who uses the app, is always my goal.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                SocialPnt was a daunting task that I wasn't confident I would be able to complete in
                                the beginning, but eventually - I did. And I cannot tell you how great that feels.

                                throughout the development lifecycle.
                                This included keeping thorough documentation on projects status, development
                                and team work-ability.

                                I was on the ground floor when it came to re-designing the Office of Research
                                website, a project that I pushed for almost immediately upon coming into my role.
                                I spent a lot of days in meetings, with every department head discussing their
                                needs, and how we could implement them in a way that made it
                                easy to find any information that you were looking for.

                            <p>I helped our team solve new and interesting problems, using a wide variety of
                                technologies to tackle these problems including,
                                <strong>AngularJS</strong>,

                                one another. This personal investment allowed me to interact with a new and growing team
                                in an environment that I had never experienced before.
                                Though my time with the company was short, due to my constraints of being a student,
                                the things that I learned were invaluable. </p>

                                    getting tired of making pixel-to-viewport conversions by hand, as in a large
                                    project you could potentially have dozens of small conversions that need to be done.

                                    With NOLS at your side you can have the peace of mind of knowing that your pixel
                                    perfect CSS looks the same on all devices.

                                <p>
                                    Other Node packages allow you to calculate a conversion, but
                                    none actually help you streamline your development process by applying the
                                    conversion in your stylesheets for you.

                                This was probably the first time that I felt like a true developer. I was looking
                                to integrate Firebase's
                                <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/dynamic-links/">Dynamic Link</a>
                                service into SocialPnt. After implementing their native SDK, I realized that their
                                coverage of edge
                                cases was significantly lacking. After searching around for a bit, I discovered
                                <a href="https://branch.io/">Branch.io</a> and immediately fell in love with
                                their service. There was only one catch. I had to get an email link from Firebase,
                                which was only accessible via their Dynamic Link service.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                After doing some digging I came up with a solution that leveraged Branch.io's edge
                                cases with Firebase's email link, and was given warm remarks
                                from one of the Branch.io developers for my work. He said he would pass my
                                solution onto their documentation team to see if it could be added to the repository,
                                as he felt that other developers would benefit from it.

                                This was an issue that I originally opened with the Ionic team, but despite receiving
                                quite some notoriety within the community it was unfortunately left unsolved.
                                The issue was with their <Strong> Ionic cordova build prod</Strong> command
                                running out of memory, even on high-end devices. This was due to one of the
                                optimizations that the command was running. The flag was causing a memory-leak
                                within some of their dependencies and the recursive use of non-project file-paths.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                This issue was only prevalent in large-scale projects, and would not be noticed by
                                beginners or simpler applications.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                After three months of testing out fixes and hoping that the team would address this
                                issue officially, I came up with a solution that solved the issue at large. Later on
                                ths issue was fixed in their <Strong>4.0</Strong> release of Ionic, but for
                                <Strong>3.x</Strong> users
                                like myself, the compiled solution worked in the meantime.

                                This was something that I originally ran into while using the Camera-Preview
                                plugin. The basis of the issue was with implementing a pinch-to-zoom directive, when
                                you couldn't interact with the camera preview directly due to library limitations.

                                notice, so that we improve the ensemble as a whole.

                                to their sign-in methods. Given the recent Facebook blowback, I wanted to move our
                                platform away from using their login platform, which was convenient, but ultimately
                                brought up some security risks we felt.
