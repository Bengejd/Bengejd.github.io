          <p class="mb-2">IPA was made to make the average Ionic developers life a little bit easier, when wanting to create the own plugin for the Ionic Framework. Creating a plugin takes a <strong>LOT</strong> initial setup. I've written <a href="https://medium.com/@JordanBenge/how-to-write-an-ionic-cordova-plugin-in-swift-8d443430b27d">Medium articles</a> about how to properly setup plugins, but I felt like even with that, the process was too convoluted for some.</p>
          <p>So instead, I wanted to make the process easier - so I created the Ionic Plugin Assistant - IPA for short. Creating the package also made my life easier, because despite writing about the topic, I'm human and forget some of the steps, and often have to Google specifics - which lead me to <strong>my</strong> article.</p>
          <p>When you run IPA, it will ask you a few questions about your plugin, such as: the plugin name, the authors name, github repo, license, etc... and then generate all of the boilerplate code, to the point that you could <strong>technically</strong> submit it to the Ionic Native platform as a new plugin - but it would probably be closed for lack of functionality.</p>
          <p>IPA ensures that your plugin will adhear to Ionic plugin standards, common community standards, and set you up for success when it comes to making your plugin. This isn't to say that it will write your plugin for you, but it will give you a basic setup to get started with, where there was none to begin with.</p>
          <p>The library generates 11 files, all with unique requirements to properly work in your specific platform & within the Ionic Framework</p>
          <p>I opened-sourced IPA under the MIT license.</p>

          <p class="mb-2">NOLS is a <strong>NodeJs</strong> package that I came up with after getting tired of making pixel-to-viewport conversions by hand, as in a large project you could potentially have dozens of small conversions that need to be done.</p>
          <p>With NOLS at your side you can have the peace of mind of knowing that your pixel perfect CSS looks the same on all devices.</p>
          <p>Other Node packages allow you to calculate a conversion, but none actually help you streamline your development process by applying the conversion in your stylesheets for you. <strong>Until NOLS.</strong></p>
          <p>What started out as a way to help myself out, has now become a pivotal part of my development process. As a result, I opened-sourced NOLS under the MIT license. So others could benefit as well.</p>
